Based on our interpretation of the data, a handful of addresses perform liquidations but a fair few have happened in AlgoFi lending history (over 2,300 in just over 4 months) and total a fair bit of change (~$1.6M).\nWe present to you some data insights into the liquidations game of AlgoFi. We have (probably) found and analyzed all liquidations that have happened on AlgoFi. We did this by walking the blockchain backwards from \"now\" until before AlgoFi was a thing and looking for \"type L\" transactions - liquidations. We then did it again, this time guided by an indexer to point at specific blocks to look at.\nYou can find the data at the end of this post in handy spreadsheet if you want to play around with it yourself, but who has time for this nowadays - it's sexy stats time! But first, a sexy disclaimer and a boring explainer:\n‚ö†Ô∏è\rWe are fairly confident that we have gotten all liquidation data correctly, but not 100% confident.

By a mile - #2 is at 117 liquidations. Most successful liquidator by seized collateral value is, unsurprisingly, the aforementioned 2HB66T..FCDL4Y, with a total of $815K worth of liquidated collateral. The liquidation incentive/profit of which works out to a neat $57K. The most expensive single liquidation transaction so far involved paying off 161,915 USDC to seize 176,200 ALGO. Liquidation incentive for that was ~12K ALGO. Most liquidated account by number of individual liquidations: WBHJL6KP7LVEOQ6LT47UT7WVWSL3NRR57WUIX2DLVASJQWCRBDQEAGGCD4 with a whopping 79 individual liquidations. Most liquidated account by seized collateral value: WBHJL6...AGGCD4 again, with a whopping $412K total collateral seized in today's fiat value. 7% ~= $29K Who are the liquidators? \"Anyone\" can liquidate. It just requires some coding. The AlgoFi lending SDK makes this easy if you have a little bit of programming experience - but you also have to know which account you can liquidate.\nIn practice you can see that most liquidations happen by a handful of users, or, more likely, their faithful silicon minions (bots). ~Note\\ to\\ self:\\ name\\ next\\ computer\\ silicon-minion~\nTop liquidators All 19 of them are üîù, but some do a bit better than others.\nWe can see the top 6 liquidators have the lion's share and have made some nice change in exchange for their service to the platform*.\n* This is not sarcastic, liquidations of bad loans must happen if you want your lent goETH to supply you with that nice lending APR instead of disappearing into the void that swallows most altcoins.

Most common seized collateral by USD value bALGO = ALGO Seizing assets pays bAssets, which can then be converted into their canonical versions with, you guessed it, some code.
