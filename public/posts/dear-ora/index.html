I like Ora. I use Ora. One could argue that I am a kind of Godfather to it, having sniped the 1284444444 asset ID that we all like.\nIn light of the first Ora halving, I took a look at Ora statistics and mining practices. The objective is to make a recommendation on Ora mining practices to reduce Ora’s negative externalities on Algorand infrastructure, while at the same time appreciating the positive externalities.\n1. TPS records and Transaction Sizes Ora community members on X and Discord have been discussing setting new TPS records with Ora. This is not possible.\nOra transaction sizes usually hover between 380 - 420 bytes, assuming no notes are used. A block on Algorand has a 5MB size limit for transactions, so taking an optimistic 400 bytes per transaction and 2.9 second block times, we get a theoretical maximum of ~4519 TPS (5 * 1024 * 1024 / 400 / 2.9).\nThis has been beat several times:\nouter ALGO payment transactions (~194 bytes) at 5K TPS sustained outer USDC asset transfers at 5.7K TPS sustained (current chainspect record - still owe you a writeup for that) blocks with 58888 and 51895 transactions, etc. Breaking these records would likely involve either small transactions (under 200 bytes) or heavy use of inner transactions.\n2. Externalities An externality is a cost or benefit that is caused by one party but financially incurred or received by another. Externalities can be negative or positive. A negative externality is the indirect imposition of a cost by one party onto another. A positive externality, on the other hand, is when one party receives an indirect benefit as a result of actions taken by another.\nOra is drenched in externalities, positive and negative.\nOra’s primary positive externality is funding the fee sink. At the time of writing, 2,854,139.97 ALGO has been sent to the fee sink via Ora mining.\nFunding the fee sink is important: when ALGO supply is 100% circulating, the fee sink will be the primary (or only?) source of funding for network security, ecosystem support, etc. The upcoming staking rewards (block production incentives) will also be funded by the fee sink.\nAnother externality is the mining transactions themselves. This is mixed, with the positive being boosting TPS and overall transactions on Algorand, but another is the cost of the Ora transactions on the ecosystem infrastructure.\nAt the time of writing, Ora stands at an impressive 436,327,140 lifetime transactions. Algorand Mainnet has 2,483,096,263 total transactions, meaning Ora accounts for 17.57% of all Algorand transactions.\nNote: the “time of writing” spanned a few days, so the numbers are not going to be 100% consistent to a single point in time.\nA lot of nodes on Algorand are “light”, in that they keep the latest 1320 blocks and are “unburdened by what has been”, i.e. the entire history of the blockchain.\nHowever, the entire blockchain history is still necessary to store, mostly in two forms:\nArchival algod nodes: these nodes store every Algorand block since genesis. You can not trustlessly validate the history of the chain without them, or feed a custom indexer via conduit. Indexers: general purpose databases that link accounts, assets, and applications to specific transactions. Used by explorers and for lookups that algod is not optimized for, such as “which accounts hold asset X and what is their balance”. At 44+ million blocks and 2.4+ billion transactions, both are hefty to store already.\nMy mainnet archival algod node:\nTotal ledger size: 1953571409920 bytes (1.77 TB), of which 1887219470336 bytes (1.71 TB) is the block ledger (ledger.block.sqlite)\nIndexers are heavier still. My mainnet indexer data directory is currently sweating at 3310307028 bytes (3.1TB). The vast majority of this weight is in the following two tables, which store transactions (2.2 TB) and relations between accounts and transactions (827 GB), totalling 3074 GB (3 TB)\ntable_name | table_size | indexes_size | total_size -------------------------------------------+------------+--------------+------------ \"public\".\"txn\" | 1989 GB | 258 GB | 2247 GB \"public\".\"txn_participation\" | 318 GB | 509 GB | 827 GB Transactions do not all “weigh” the same, but a back of the envelope division gives us:\nAverage block ledger space per txn: ~760.03 bytes Average indexer space per txn: ~1329.26 bytes (txn \u0026 txn_participation tables) To estimate Ora algod storage, I will provide two estimations - one with the 400 byte average Ora transaction size (which will be an undercount as it does not include other overheads for storage, and is not reflective of the actual average Ora transaction size) and one with the average transaction size of 760 bytes (which may be an overestimate)\n436327140 * 400 = 162.54 GB 436327140 * 760 = 308.83 GB For indexers we will use the average 1329.26 byte size for lack of a better metric:\n436327140 * 1329.26 = 540.16 GB 3. Ora best (?) mining practices Everything I’ve seen from the Ora community makes me believe that they are absolutely aligned with the success of Algorand and our broader ecosystem.\nIt is in this spirit that I will humbly suggest that the best practice for Ora mining should also take into account the overhead incurred on archival nodes and indexers.\nIn practice this would mean:\nWhen possible, opt for mining with the maximum transaction fees. When possible, minimize the note field size. Fewer transactions, same outcomes From a miner point of view, 10 transactions with 0.002 fee are equivalent to 1 transaction with 0.02 fee. The same work (Ora effort) is being produced, the same fees are paid into the sink.\nThe major difference is that archivals and indexers need to store 10 transactions instead of 1, and over hundreds of millions of transactions, this overhead adds up to something significant.\nI pulled some statistics for the lifetime average fee paid by Ora miners:\nOra transaction count: 436350671 Ora transactions’ average fee: 0.006540 ALGO Ora total fees: 2,854,139.97 ALGO If you embrace mining closer to 0.02 than 0.002, the same work product will be possible with a lot less overhead on the infrastructure.\n“No notes” Ideally Ora miners would not include notes in their transactions. In certain cases, miners are settings notes to hunders of characters. This is not beneficial to anyone.\nIf you are a miner, please check if your mining transactions are currently including large notes.\nMake sure you are checking the base64 or hex representation of the note. This seemingly short note is actually taking up 411 bytes:\nWrapping Up I don’t want to wax on for longer than necessary.\nYou can keep doing what you are doing, but with ~10x less impact to the ecosystem infrastructure by following the two points mentioned above: fewer overall transactions, and smaller individual transaction sizes.\nThe ledger is there to be filled, but growing it more/faster than necessary incurs additional costs on the infrastructure of our ecosystem. If you are aligned with the success of our ecosystem, and in particular with our infrastructure providers, consider changing your mining practices to reflect that.\nSlower growth in ledger space (archival algod) means the ecosystem as a whole can keep costs lower for longer. Free indexers being available to everyone means that developer and project onboarding is easier.\nSubsigners This is the gist of this open letter:\nDear Ora Miners,\nPlease minimize the load of Ora on the ecosystem infrastructure by transaction count and size. Consider mining with maximum fees (0.02 ALGO) and without large notes in your transaction.\nThe following have signed this message:\nIf you want to sign this message, you can do so on-chain.\n","wordCount":"1295","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/images/logo-7-green-384-padded-doofy.png","datePublished":"2024-11-14T12:02:10+01:00","dateModified":"2024-11-14T12:02:10+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bit @ D13.co"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/dear-ora/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"D13.co","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="  (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/images/logo-7-green-128.png alt aria-label=logo height=48></a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Dear Ora: An open letter to Ora miners
