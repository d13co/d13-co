      <title>Tinyman Governance: Community Audit</title>
      <link>https://d13.co/posts/tinyman-governance-community-audit/</link>

      <guid>https://d13.co/posts/tinyman-governance-community-audit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I initially started investigating and disclosing &lt;a href=&#34;https://d13.co/posts/disclosure-tales-01-honing-fire/&#34;&gt;smart contract&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://d13.co/posts/disclosure-tales-02-downward-facing-daos/&#34;&gt;vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;, part of my intentions were to build up a portfolio in order to attract paid engagements as a smart contract auditor. This article discusses one such engagement, which came with a very interesting twist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief&#34;&gt;Brief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://tinyman.org/&#34;&gt;Tinyman team&lt;/a&gt; is developing an on-chain Governance platform for their protocol. With Tinyman being a staple of the Algorand DeFi ecosystem and a personal favorite of mine, when they approached me about my interest in auditing the contracts, the speech bubble over my head clearly read &amp;ldquo;you bet your tiny ass I&amp;rsquo;m in!&amp;rdquo;. As it turned out, it would be even more interesting that a simple solo audit: Tinyman put together an ad-hoc team of developers and experts in the AVM to review the contracts as a group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thoughts on &#34;a&#34; musing on the pond: Dynamic supply for Algorand</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@fishermanalgo/musings-on-the-pond-f1c6f6deeb72&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Musings on the pond&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; article lays out a thought-provoking proposal for a deep intervention in Algorand&amp;rsquo;s economics.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have not read it, it is well worth putting it at the top of your reading list and getting to it soon - even now, in fact: if you have the time, go &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@fishermanalgo/musings-on-the-pond-f1c6f6deeb72&#34;&gt;read that first&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the proposed interventions is &lt;strong&gt;a set of changes to the minimum transaction fee, block rewards and fee burns that would alter the fixed nature of the total supply of Algorand.&lt;/strong&gt; The present article discusses these changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Disclosure Tales 02: Downward Facing DAOs</title>
      <link>https://d13.co/posts/disclosure-tales-02-downward-facing-daos/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 00:06:38 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://d13.co/posts/disclosure-tales-02-downward-facing-daos/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I discovered and disclosed a vulnerability in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.updog.vote&#34;&gt;Updog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.algofame.org/dao&#34;&gt;FAME&lt;/a&gt; DAO contracts. Then I hacked them. This story is not boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-the-daos&#34;&gt;Background: The DAOs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.updog.vote&#34;&gt;Updog&lt;/a&gt; offered a fully featured DAO platform. In a nutshell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each DAO instance has a governance token that can be staked and withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DAO contracts could control assets and ALGO. Payments of both types could be executed trustlessly after a proposal passed with enough votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting power is proportional to the staked amount of governance tokens in the DAO.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Disclosure Tales 01: Honing Fire</title>
      <link>https://d13.co/posts/disclosure-tales-01-honing-fire/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I discovered and disclosed a vulnerability in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nft.hone.fi/&#34;&gt;Hone NFT shuffle&lt;/a&gt; contracts. They responded well. This story is almost boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-backstory&#34;&gt;The backstory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious about the mechanics of the Hone NFT shuffle, as it utilizes VRF, in which I have a keen interest. Reading TEAL is a bit like reading assembly, but with enough determination and a bit of practice you can figure out what a contract is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally you can also spot a combination of transactions or parameters that breaks the assumptions of the contract developer. The dopamine rush from finding and verifying a vulnerability in a smart contract is probably equivalent to snorting 1,000 ground-up sudoku puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article will guide you through setting up a Voi participation node on the latest Ubuntu LTS (22.04). It assumes you start with a local or remote (server/cloud) installation. Version 20.04 should also work, but is not tested extensively. This guide is only suitable for &lt;code&gt;x86&lt;/code&gt; architecture machines as it relies on the Algorand repository, which does not publish packages for other architectures such as ARM64.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://d13.co/myalgo-hack-fifth-wave-addresses-data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The MyAlgo attacks have so far been clustered around five distinct
waves, roughly corresponding to these dates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Wave: February 20, 2023&lt;br&gt;
Second Wave: March 5, 2023&lt;br&gt;
Third Wave: March 6, 2023&lt;br&gt;
Fourth Wave: March 17, 2023&lt;br&gt;
Fifth Wave: March 31, 2023&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article presents data from the fifth wave - March 31 - as well as
subsequent movements of stolen funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack was automated and ran for 14 hours - from 2023-03-31 10:15
(GMT) until 2023-04-01 00:25 (GMT). ASAs were drained from 4,166
accounts into the following malicious account:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Preliminary Advisory Report - Algorand 20-02-2023 Thefts</title>
      <link>https://d13.co/algorand-20-02-2023-thefts-preliminary-advisory-report/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 21:26:38 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://d13.co/algorand-20-02-2023-thefts-preliminary-advisory-report/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: There is a non-zero chance of a MyAlgo wallet software
compromise leading to the theft of at least $7.2m worth of assets on
the Algorand blockchain. We recommend rekeying MyAlgo accounts to fresh
private keys, or simply moving funds where possible. This precautionary
remediation of further risk should not have usability impact and, if
done carefully, may have a significant security benefit.&lt;/strong&gt;\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been &lt;a href=&#34;https://allo.info/tx/54QEQKNH66ZW3FT2LQU7QQ6LFX7QVABXJYK7LM6WAHJNQ3M5W2PQ&#34;&gt;day 1
responders&lt;/a&gt;
to these attacks:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Algo_Surf/status/1627827487668424707&#34;&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt;
the potential compromises, organizing affected users, systematically
collecting as much information as possible in order to find a possible
common vector, suggesting actions to be taken, preparing transaction
trail documents for authorities. This case quickly grew with multiple
confirmations and more discoveries daily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Algorand AMM 1:1 real world swap performance</title>
      <link>https://d13.co/benchmarking-algorand-amm-real-user-swap-performance/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 02:18:38 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://d13.co/benchmarking-algorand-amm-real-user-swap-performance/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL; DR: We tested Algorand with end-user-identical AMM swaps: 8,070 in a 3 second block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our friends at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://vestige.fi/&#34;&gt;Vestige.fi&lt;/a&gt;
recently performed a benchmark of AMM swap performance on Algorand
MainNet. While the results were great (2881 peak swaps per second), some
naysayers missed the forest for the trees with complaints about the
methodology being synthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
&lt;a href=&#34;https://discord.com/channels/491256308461207573/491256308461207575/1061347210060644413&#34;&gt;methodology&lt;/a&gt;
by the Vestige team was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;We sent 353 groups of 85 swaps totaling 90368 transactions / 30005
AMM swaps. Algorand therefore handled 30005 AMM swaps in ~15 sec,
or about 2000 swaps/s. If we discount the last ~500 swaps in the
806 block we instead get 29500/11 sec = 2680 swaps. If someone
smarter than me has data on block times we could do better
calculations, in case blocks were delayed or so. &amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;all transactions were made from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://allo.info/address/SWAPVMWRFIIY2L5V2JEWXIE7TLSOCUJP4BJYMAM65VBMRXHHE24GBMMPYM&#34;&gt;https://allo.info/address/SWAPVMWRFIIY2L5V2JEWXIE7TLSOCUJP4BJYMAM65VBMRXHHE24GBMMPYM&lt;/a&gt;
which called the app 1000469889 which does 85 swaps in inner
transactions (255/3)&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Algorand, inner transactions are transactions initiated by a smart
contract. As such, they don&#39;t need to come with a signature attached -
the outer transaction call&#39;s signature suffices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting up an Algorand consensus participation server on Oracle Cloud for free</title>
      <link>https://d13.co/set-up-algorand-participation-node-on-oracle-cloud-free/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 02:18:38 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://d13.co/set-up-algorand-participation-node-on-oracle-cloud-free/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Running an Algorand consensus participation node requires a bit of
patience and a bit of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, consensus participation currently isn&#39;t rewarded by the
network - only by our conscience! Most cloud providers do not accept
conscience bucks, so we will do what we can with free offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oracle Cloud has an &amp;quot;always free&amp;quot; tier which includes good-enough
virtual servers for our purposes. Traditionally this is where I state my
affiliations and paid promotions, but there are none in this case. &lt;del&gt;I am
a happy Oracle free tier user and that&#39;s it.&lt;/del&gt; No money has exchanged
hands for the production of this article. There is one minor gotcha
which I will treat as a cliff-hanger for now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Algorand Governance Period 4 Whales: Known wallets &amp; Consensus participation statistics</title>
      <link>https://d13.co/algorand-governance-whales-known-wallets-consensus-participation-stats/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 21:26:38 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://d13.co/algorand-governance-whales-known-wallets-consensus-participation-stats/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up on our report on &lt;a href=&#34;https://d13.co/algorand-governance-voting-power-centralization-period-4/&#34;&gt;Voting Power Centralization in
Governance Period
4&lt;/a&gt;
we decided to look into known addresses from the governor whale list, as
well as their consensus participation status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it and can&#39;t be bothered to check, we defined
&amp;quot;whale wallets&amp;quot; as single-entity governors that have committed at
least 1 million ALGO and are still eligible. We excluded the top
governor - Folks Finance - as their vote is decided by Folks protocol
users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed the top eligible wallets enrolled for Algorand Governance
Period 4 as of August 21, 2022. The data shows a very &amp;quot;whale&amp;quot; heavy
distribution of voting power and rewards, where the top 37 individual
&amp;quot;whale&amp;quot; wallets control the vote and reap 50% of rewards, and wallets
with over 1 million ALGO commitment control 86% of the vote and rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-sources&#34;&gt;Data Sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get our raw data, we used two different data sources and correlated
them to confirm correctness:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AlgoFi vault reward performance for Governance period 3</title>
      <link>https://d13.co/algofi-vault-reward-performance-for-governance-period-3/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 02:18:38 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://d13.co/algofi-vault-reward-performance-for-governance-period-3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: Maximizing our vaulted ALGO with borrowed ALGO yielded more than
2x in governance rewards profit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third Governance season we tried the AlgoFi vault for
Governance: AlgoFi counts vaulted Algo as collateral that you can borrow
against. Borrowing Algo against your vaulted algo has two advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can add the borrowed algo to the vault, thus increasing your
collateral and ability to borrow more Algo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are not exposed to liquidation danger due to price fluctuations
between your collateral and borrow value, as they are the same
&lt;del&gt;picture&lt;/del&gt; price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your risk in this scheme is essentially confined to smart contract risk:
AlgoFi vault contracts failing either catastrophically (entire vaulted
amount lost) or partially (inability to vote and/or claim rewards). This
was palatable to our risk tolerance considering AlgoFi&#39;s reputation and
audits, so we tested it out on a few accounts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is It Algorand&#39;s Birthday? ...dot com</title>
      <link>https://d13.co/isitalgorandsbirthday/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To celebrate Algorand MainNet&#39;s third birthday on the 11th of June
2022, we set up a mini-project consisting of a countdown timer to the
big day: &lt;a href=&#34;https://isitalgorandsbirthday.com/&#34;&gt;is it algorands birthday dot
com&lt;/a&gt;
and a midi project that will be revealed there on Algorand&#39;s big day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked June 11 from Block Zero&#39;s timestamp on MainNet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;2019-06-11T00:00:00Z&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At midnight the countdown will transition to a web2.0 celebration
extravaganza. CSS3 is definitely invited, and even 3D may make a cameo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Algod-Loadb: An aware Algod HTTP Load Balancer</title>
      <link>https://d13.co/algod-loadb-an-aware-algod-http-load-balancer/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you want to do High Availability Algorand stuff. But algod, your
trusty portal to and from the Algorand blockchain, can betray you in a
number of ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can go down for upgrades. algod must be up to date to keep
syncing. It is recommended to set up a cron job to attempt to update
algod every day. This will usually include some downtime &lt;del&gt;we\ think&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can go down for not upgrading. We had a (non-production) algod
which got stuck on a particular block. After looking into it, it was
a couple of versions old, and after a pre-agreed-upon round, it just
stopped syncing. Updating was quickish - the update script worked
great, but it did require some time to migrate/rebuid some index
files to the latest version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can get stuck, or be left behind, because software is hard,
complicated and unpredictable in fascinating ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are building a bunch of stuff on Algorand, and one of them definitely
requires H/A - the &lt;a href=&#34;https://d13.co/algofi-borrow-utilization-monitoring-service&#34;&gt;AlgoFi Borrow Utilization Monitoring
Service&lt;/a&gt;.
This puppy will keep track of every AlgoFi account&#39;s utilization
percentage, as well as the AlgoFi oracle lending prices, in order to
calculate borrow utilization and notify users when theirs exceeds
whatever threshold they have specified. We want this done at every
single block, 24/7/365, guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we&#39;re launching our first Algorand product soon, we wanted to have a
space where people can reach out and talk to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were a bit surprised to find that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://reddit.com/r/D13&#34;&gt;/r/D13&lt;/a&gt;
was available as a subreddit! We promptly claimed it and are in the
process of filling it out with some content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to ask us anything, feel free to drop by and post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit our subreddit:

      <title>Every AlgoFi Liquidation: Stats &amp; Data</title>
      <link>https://d13.co/algofi-liquidations-stats-data/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following a positive response to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/algofi/comments/tyid2i/anyone_interested_in_a_liquidation_monitoring/&#34;&gt;a reddit post&lt;/a&gt;
I made about the need for an AlgoFi borrow utilization &amp;amp; liquidation
notification service, Hellen and I started looking into
&lt;a href=&#34;https://algofi.org/&#34;&gt;AlgoFi&lt;/a&gt;
blockchain data relating to lending &amp;amp; liquidations. We prepared a nice
spreadsheet with every single liquidation, as well as some nice stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-a-liquidation&#34;&gt;What&#39;s a liquidation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you take a loan out on AlgoFi, if your collateral&#39;s value drops to
be worth less than your maximum allowed borrow value*, your account can
be liquidated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
