      <title>Preliminary Advisory Report - Algorand 20-02-2023 Thefts</title>
      <link>https://d13.co/algorand-20-02-2023-thefts-preliminary-advisory-report/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: There is a non-zero chance of a MyAlgo wallet software
compromise leading to the theft of at least $7.2m worth of assets on
the Algorand blockchain. We recommend rekeying MyAlgo accounts to fresh
private keys, or simply moving funds where possible. This precautionary
remediation of further risk should not have usability impact and, if
done carefully, may have a significant security benefit.&lt;/strong&gt;\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been &lt;a href=&#34;https://allo.info/tx/54QEQKNH66ZW3FT2LQU7QQ6LFX7QVABXJYK7LM6WAHJNQ3M5W2PQ&#34;&gt;day 1
responders&lt;/a&gt;
to these attacks:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Algo_Surf/status/1627827487668424707&#34;&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt;
the potential compromises, organizing affected users, systematically
collecting as much information as possible in order to find a possible
common vector, suggesting actions to be taken, preparing transaction
trail documents for authorities. This case quickly grew with multiple
confirmations and more discoveries daily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
