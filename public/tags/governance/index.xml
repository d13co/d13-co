      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up on our report on &lt;a href=&#34;https://d13.co/algorand-governance-voting-power-centralization-period-4/&#34;&gt;Voting Power Centralization in
Governance Period
4&lt;/a&gt;
we decided to look into known addresses from the governor whale list, as
well as their consensus participation status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it and can&#39;t be bothered to check, we defined
&amp;quot;whale wallets&amp;quot; as single-entity governors that have committed at
least 1 million ALGO and are still eligible. We excluded the top
governor - Folks Finance - as their vote is decided by Folks protocol
users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Algorand Governance Voting Power Centralization - Period 4</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed the top eligible wallets enrolled for Algorand Governance
Period 4 as of August 21, 2022. The data shows a very &amp;quot;whale&amp;quot; heavy
distribution of voting power and rewards, where the top 37 individual
&amp;quot;whale&amp;quot; wallets control the vote and reap 50% of rewards, and wallets
with over 1 million ALGO commitment control 86% of the vote and rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-sources&#34;&gt;Data Sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get our raw data, we used two different data sources and correlated
them to confirm correctness:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AlgoFi vault reward performance for Governance period 3</title>
      <link>https://d13.co/algofi-vault-reward-performance-for-governance-period-3/</link>

      <guid>https://d13.co/algofi-vault-reward-performance-for-governance-period-3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: Maximizing our vaulted ALGO with borrowed ALGO yielded more than
2x in governance rewards profit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third Governance season we tried the AlgoFi vault for
Governance: AlgoFi counts vaulted Algo as collateral that you can borrow
against. Borrowing Algo against your vaulted algo has two advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can add the borrowed algo to the vault, thus increasing your
collateral and ability to borrow more Algo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are not exposed to liquidation danger due to price fluctuations
between your collateral and borrow value, as they are the same
&lt;del&gt;picture&lt;/del&gt; price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your risk in this scheme is essentially confined to smart contract risk:
AlgoFi vault contracts failing either catastrophically (entire vaulted
amount lost) or partially (inability to vote and/or claim rewards). This
was palatable to our risk tolerance considering AlgoFi&#39;s reputation and
audits, so we tested it out on a few accounts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
